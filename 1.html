<p>The HTML br tag, which stands for "line break," <br> is used to insert a line break within a block of text,<br> causing the content that follows it to appear on a new line. Unlike the p (paragraph) tag, which creates a distinct new paragraph with its own spacing,<br> the br tag simply breaks the current line of text without introducing extra vertical space. It is a self-closing or "empty" tag, meaning it does not require a separate closing tag.<br> The br tag is particularly useful in scenarios like formatting addresses, poems, or song lyrics where individual lines need to be separated without creating new paragraphs. While it serves a purely presentational purpose and lacks semantic meaning, its proper use enhances readability and visual organization within textual content on a webpage.</p>
